Also this is for people who are new to learning python and want some recap to what is going on in the language

#Why Python

Python is an open source programming language which can do a lot for whatever project you are working on for example:

1. Databases
2. Game Development (mainly 2D)
3. Desktop Applications
4. Web Applications
5. Machine Learning
6. Automation of things
7. Software Developement
8. etc

<h3>Why you should learn python compared to other languages</h3>
In my opinion Python is one of the best languages to learn as a begginer because of how vast it is 

#About me
I have started learning python since 2019 so if I miss something don't bully me   
(I am still leaning Python on top of over things like __**git**__ and __**GitHub**__)

(I will be using Python version 3.7)
