# To grab a user's input you would want to use a key word called:
input()  # The input word basically means it is prompting to do something

# For example the user would want
input("what is your name") # here the input is asking for the users name

# Another example (more in depth) you dont need to worry about it I will say what it means later on

choices = ["yes", "no"]				# Variable (its not needed but I put it there so I can remember what the variable would have)
choices = input('Are you ready?')	# Input
if choices == "yes":				# if statement
	print("yes")						# Result
elif choices == "no":				# elif statement
	print("no")							# Result
