# A variable is a container for something to be assigned to

hello = "bye" # In other words the variable contents "bye" is being assigned to the variable word 'hello'

print(hello) # I am printing the 'hello' variable so to the console it would print "bye"

# You can do all sorts with variables from:
type(hello) #This gets the objects name, so this would be a variable

# This is one of many things you can do with variables
