print('Hello world')
# Breakdown The word print, prints to the console whatever you want to be printed but in this case I have decided to
# print Hello world
# This is the most basic thing you can do with any python project

# The hello world part counts as a string because it is in single (or double) quotes

# Strings are for Words
